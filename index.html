<h2>Hi. I'm Caroline.</h2>
<p>It's February 4th in 2022 and I am a student at GCU.</p>

<p>I am currently in my fourth semester and still majoring in Biology with an Emphasis in Pre-Med, 
however, I recently took on Cybersecurity as a minor because I'm not sure what I want to do with my life.
At the moment, one of my focuses is saving up for an iPad so that I can pursue my interest in drawing as
well as use it for school-related tasks. I'm excited to be able to write directly onto Word documents and
PDFs because I feel it will allow me to better engage with the material as well as submit assignments easier.
After I get an iPad, I will begin saving up for an adjustable/standing desk. If you have not heard of
it before, it is merely a desk in which you can adjust the height. One little setback in my buying an iPad,
and consequently an adjustable desk, is my purchase of handmade spoons from South Korea. I bought three and they
are all incredibly cute, and I plan on gifting two of them to two of my closest friends.

<h3>Some hobbies I'd like to learn:</h3>

<p style="color:purple;">I don't have a favorite color but purple is nice.</p>
